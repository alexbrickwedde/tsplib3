# TSP++ 3.0 - C/C++ library to create TAPI Service Provider Drivers

This library was a commercial product for [julmar.com](http://www.julmar.com) for many years. It is a C++ library designed to help create TAPI 2.x service providers.

This code comes with no support or promises. I have released it because people have asked for it - but it's too far in my past for me to realistically remember much. However, it had full documentation (contained here).
